In the dim and distant past great knowledge was gathered and stored in the "Library of Maturam". This repository was the 
center of learning, education , scientific and magical progress in the world. All record and trace of the library was
lost during "The Cataclysm". Somewhere within it's halls was the greatest treasure in the known world. This treasure, 
"The Tome of Semblance", will allow a knowledgable maigc user to restore lands and resources.
  
A mighty storm has recently uncovered what the "Arch-Mage Mephisto" believes is the entrance to the library. It is hoped 
that now after two centuries the artifact can be recovered and the realm restored to it's former glory.
  
Are you up to the challenge?
Can you retrieve the book and save Maturam?
The fate of the known world is in your hands.
